1. To compile, ensure you have Python v3.8 installed on your system.
2. In order to start the web server, you want to open the WebServer.py with Python v3.8.
3. A terminal will open, and display the text "Ready to serve CSCI340 Students..."
4. Simply navigate to the IP address of the server, which is your local machine IP,
	followed by the port number specified in the python file (6789 currently) and the
	file you would like to request (like HelloWorld.html).
5. My host ip is 172.16.161.134, and I want the HelloWorld.html file so I navigate to 
	http://172.16.161.134:6789/HelloWorld.html
6. You will receive the HelloWorld.html file in your web browser, displaying that it was
	successful & the code was written by Kollen and Liam, and the web server terminal 
	will show a connection and a GET request.
